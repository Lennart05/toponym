\title{Saves multiple maps and toponym data}
\usage{
topCompOut(countries, len, rat, polygon, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{countries}{a character string vector with country designations (names or ISO-codes).}

\item{len}{numeric. The length of the substring within toponyms.}

\item{rat}{numeric. The cut-off ratio (a number between 0.0 and 1) of how many occurrences of a toponym string need to be in the polygon relative to the rest of the country (or countries).}

\item{polygon}{data frame. Defines the polygon for comparison with the remainder of a country (or countries).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters:
\itemize{
\item\code{df} logical. If \code{TRUE}, the filtered data frames will be saved in the global environment.
\item\code{csv} logical. If \code{TRUE}, the filtered data frames will be saved as .csv in the current working directory.
\item\code{tsv} logical. If \code{TRUE}, the filtered data frames will be saved as .tsv in the current working directory.
\item\code{type} character string. Either by default "$" (ending) or "^" (beginning)
\item\code{feat.class} a character string vector. Selects data only of those feature classes (check \url{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt} for the list of all feature classes). By default, it is \code{P}.
\item\code{freq.type} character string. If "abs" (the default), ratios of absolute frequencies inside the polygon and in the countries as a whole are computed. If "rel", ratios of relative frequencies inside the polygon and outside the polygon will be computed.
\item\code{limit} numeric. The number of the most frequent toponyms which will be tested.
}}
}
\value{
Data frames and plots saved in a sub folder (called 'dataframes' and 'plots') in the working directory or global environment.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the most frequent substrings of toponyms in a given polygon relative to country frequencies. It generates maps of them and saves them along with the corresponding data frames.
}
\details{
This function applies the list of toponyms returned by \code{topComp()} to \code{top()}.
A series of maps showing the toponym, ratio in percentage and numbers will be generated and locally saved.
Parameter \code{countries} accepts all designations found in \code{country(query = "country table")}.
Polygons passed through the \code{polygon} parameter need to intersect a country of \code{countries}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
topCompOut(
  countries = "BE", limit = 100, len = 3, rat = .5,
  toponym::flanders_polygon
)

## generates and saves the data frames & maps of the top hundred three-character-long endings
## in Belgium if more than 50\% of the places lie in the polygon for Flanders.
