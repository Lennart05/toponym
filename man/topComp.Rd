\title{Compares toponyms in a polygon and the remainder of countries}
\usage{
topComp(countries, len, rat, polygon, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{countries}{character string vector with country designations (names or ISO-codes).}

\item{len}{numeric. The length of the substring within toponyms.}

\item{rat}{numeric. The cut-off ratio (a number between 0.0 and 1 for \code{freq.type = "abs"}) of how many occurrences of a toponym string need to be in the polygon relative to the rest of the country (or countries).}

\item{polygon}{data frame. Defines the polygon for comparison with the remainder of a country (or countries).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters:
\itemize{
\item\code{type} character string. Either by default "$" (ending) or "^" (beginning).
\item\code{feat.class} character string vector. Selects data only of those feature classes (check \url{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt} for the list of all feature classes). By default, it is \code{P}.
\item\code{freq.type} character string. If "abs" (the default), ratios of absolute frequencies inside the polygon and in the countries as a whole are computed. If "rel", ratios of relative frequencies inside the polygon and outside the polygon will be computed.
\item\code{limit} numeric. The number of the most frequent toponym substrings which will be tested.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame printed out and saved in the global environment. It shows toponym substrings surpassing the ratio, the ratio and the frequency.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the most frequent toponym substrings in a given polygon relative to country frequencies.
}
\details{
This function sorts the toponym substrings in the given countries by frequency. It then tests which ones lie in the given polygon and prints out a data frame with those that match the ratio criterion.
Parameter \code{countries} accepts all designations found in \code{country(query = "country table")}.
Polygons passed through the \code{polygon} parameter need to intersect or be within a country specified by the \code{countries} parameter.

\examples{
\dontrun{
topComp("GB",
  limit = 100,
   len = 4,
    rat = .7,
  polygon = toponym::danelaw_polygon
)
## prints and saves a data frame of the top 100 four-character-long endings in the United Kingdom
## if more than 70\% of them belong to the polygon
## corresponding to the Danelaw area.


topComp("GB",
  limit = 100,
  len = 3,
  rat = 1,
  polygon = toponym::danelaw_polygon,
  freq.type = "rel"
)
## prints and saves a data frame of the top 100 three-character-long endings in the United Kingdom
## if they have greater relative frequencies within Danelaw than outside of Danelaw.


topComp(c("BE", "NL"),
  limit = 50,
  len = 3,
  rat = .8,
  polygon = toponym::flanders_polygon
)

## prints and saves a data frame of the top 50 three-character-long endings
## in Belgium and Netherlands viewed as a unit if more than 80\% of them belong to the polygon
## corresponding to Flanders.
